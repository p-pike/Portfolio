## What is in this repository ? 
- Churn dataset analysis : predict if a customer is going to leave for a competitor.
- Titanic dataset analysis : predict if a passenger has survived.
- Movie reviews dataset analysis : predict if a review is positive or negative.

The purpose of these analyses is to find the model that best fits our problematics. These are classification problems.

## How to run ?
To run a Jupyter Notebook you can use:
- Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/ (download link)

You must ensure that the python packages are installed with the correct version. For this purpose you can run the first cell in the _importing librairies_ section.

**Note:** To avoid recomputing I have saved trained models in pickle files. But it is possible to redo the training, by setting the variable redo_training to true (in _global variables_).
